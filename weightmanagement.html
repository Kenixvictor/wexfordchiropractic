<h1>Weight Management:<br />
  Permanent weight loss and optimum health</h1>
<p>Achieve your desired body weight through balance. Experts are now calling
  the fattening of America a national epidemic. Despite dramatically reducing
  the fat in our national diet over the last 15 years, Americans continue to
  put on weight. In 1991, one third of the population was found to be obese,
  a 32% increase in 10 years. While intake of saturated fats and cholesterol
  were decreasing, the weight of America's young adults increased by 10 pounds.</p>
<p>It has been discovered that a balanced ratio of macronutrients (i.e. proteins,
  carbohydrates, and fats) in our diets, along with proper calorie intake and
  exercise are keys to permanent weight loss and optimum health.</p>
  <h2>Weight Loss in Wexford, Gibsonia, Pittsburgh, Pine &amp; Marshall Townships</h2>
<p>If you are looking for help with weight management in the Wexford, Gibsonia, Pittsburgh, Pine or Marshall Townships area please call the Wexford Chiropractic Centre at 724-935-1610</p>
<h2>Standard Process Purification Program</h2>
<p>The 21-day Standard Process Purification Program utilizes whole food supplements; whole, organic, and unprocessed food; and water to cleanse the body so that you can have more energy, maintain a healthy weight, and improve your digestion. Purifying offers you a way to enjoy the best your body has to offer.</p>
<h3>Why do I need purification?</h3>
<p>Purification, also known as detoxification, can help you remove natural toxins from your body and help maintain a healthy weight. We are exposed to external toxins every day, including pollutants, pesticides and chemicals. Internally our bodies produce waste by-products as a result of normal metabolic function. Although your body is designed to rid itself of these toxins naturally, it can become overburdened. Purification offers your body additional support to expel natural toxins and minimize your weight, which is important to maintaining your health and vitality.</p>
<ul>
<p>Toxins can contribute to a wide range of conditions:</p>

  
<li>Stuffy head</li>
 <li> Fatigue or difficulty sleeping</li>
 <li>
    Digestion and other gastrointestinal problems</li>
 <li>
    Food cravings and weight gain</li>
 <li>
    Reduced mental clarity</li>
 <li>
    Low libido</li>
</ul>
<h2>Program Basics</h2>
<p>The foundation of our 21-day purification program includes eating whole, organic and unprocessed foods; taking whole food supplements; and drinking plenty of water. You will eat vegetables and fruit from days 1-10, with select proteins added at day 11.</p>
<h2>How do I maintain a healthy weight?</h2>
<p>After purification, you will have learned how to treat your body better by eating healthier and exercising more frequently. You will also have a new attitude toward food. You will see how the unhealthy things you may have craved during the program aren't as desirable as you thought. You will see how they make you feel and you may find that they won't meet your expectations. Even after reaching your desired weight, continue with our post-purification program to maintain a healthy weight, for now and years to come. </p>
