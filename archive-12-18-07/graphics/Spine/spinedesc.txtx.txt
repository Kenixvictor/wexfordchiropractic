              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The 
                spine is made up of a series of vertebrae. These vertebrae are 
                split into categories.<br>
                The categories are cervical, thoracic,<br>
				lumbar and sacral.
                The cervical vertebrae are numbered from C1 down to C7.<br>
                The thoracic vertebrae are numbered from T1<br> down to T12.
                <br>The lumbar vertebrae are numbered from<br> L1 down to L5.<br>
                The sacral vertebrae are numbered from<br> S1 down to S5.</strong></font></p>
              <p align="left"><strong><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There 
                are two types of spinal cord injury.<br> One is a complete injury 
                and the other is an incomplete injury.</font></strong></p>

                two people who have suffered a complete injury to the spinal cord 
                at the same point (for example T10) will have the same amount 
                of movement as each other.<br>
                This does not apply to people who have suffered an incomplete 
                injury. Each incomplete injury is very different to the next one.
