<h1>New Patient Experience  </h1>
<p>All around the world, people are realizing that Chiropractic care is a natural
  and safer way of obtaining and keeping good health. Chiropractic care is a
  conservative, drug-free approach to better health that has helped millions
  of people since 1895.</p>
<h2>First Step: Free Consultation</h2>
<p>The first step to feeling healthy is to schedule your Free Consultation and
  explore the benefits of chiropractic care. During this consultation, the doctor
  will discuss your overall health, previous medical history and the reason you
  are visiting, as well as your diet, sleeping patterns, work environment, and
  exercise routine. Together, the two of you will discuss what options are available
  to you and how you can achieve optimal health.</p>
<p>The Free Consultation is a great way for you to discover the benefits that
  chiropractic care can provide for you and your family. In addition, before
  anything is done, the cost of exam and/ or x-rays is discussed.</p>
<p class="contact2"><strong>Please fill out the
      <a href="case_history_form.pdf">Case History Form</a> before
    your first visit to the Wexford Chiropractic Centre.</strong></p>
<h2>Second Step: The Examination</h2>
<p>Your first examination will allow us to gain a complete understanding of your
  condition. This helps to ascertain the tissues involved. After all, pain can
  come from muscles, joints, ligaments, nerves, etc. Determining the source of
  the problem helps the Doctor to develop a plan of care. After the exam, x-rays
  are taken when needed to provide us with a picture of your sPine and even limited
  soft tissue structure. On occasion, depending on your injury, other advanced
  testing may be required to insure that your condition is properly diagnosed.</p>
<h2>Third Step: The Health Care Report</h2>
<p>On your return visit, you and Dr. Vactor will sit down and discuss his evaluation
  from your initial exam. We will determine if you are in need of chiropractic
  care or a referral to another healthcare specialist. If we determine that chiropractic
  care is an option, we will then discuss what can be done about your problem,
  how long we expect treatment to last in order to meet your goals and how much
  treatment will cost.</p>
