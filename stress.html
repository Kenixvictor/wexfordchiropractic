<h1>Stress Management  </h1>
<p>Stress can harm the body. The major detrimental effect is a glandular imbalance,
  which causes an imbalance of the autonomic nervous system. This is the system
  that primarily controls the organs and glands. Stress that is prolonged ultimately
  causes harm to the body. Chiropractic care, along with proper nutritional support,
  can reduce the harmful effects of stress so that you feel good again naturally.</p>
<h2>Stress Management  in Wexford, Gibsonia, Pittsburgh, Pine &amp; Marshall Townships</h2>
<p>If you are looking for help with stress management in the Wexford, Gibsonia, Pittsburgh, Pine or Marshall Townships area please call the Wexford Chiropractic Centre at 724-935-1610</p>
<h2>How well do you adapt to stress?</h2>
<p>For some, it's an upset stomach. For others, recurring headaches, back pain, or muscle stiffness. Still others respond with nervous twitches, allergic reactions, or sensitivities to chemicals. Regardless of your particular response, the function of your nervous system is involved. That's why chiropractic can be so helpful.</p>
<p>The chiropractic approach to stress is to help normalize the function of your nervous system by removing interferences caused by the Vertebral Subluxation Complex or spinal joint dysfunction.</p>
<p>Finding the &quot;weak links&quot; in your sPine (the major communication pathway of your nervous system) and helping restore better function, can make a profound difference in your response to stress.</p>
<p>It may not be possible to remove the stress from a busy life. However, with the help of your chiropractic doctor, you can respond better to the unique challenges you face.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Similar to exercise, chiropractic adjustments can help reduce tension in the nervous system, improving your ability to tolerate and adapt to the stresses of modern life.<br />
  </li>
  <li>Just as a chain tends to break at its weakest link, we seem to exhibit stress and strain in the weakest areas of our bodies.</li>
  <li>Like a relaxing vacation, chiropractic care can help give your nervous system a greater capacity to adapt to stress.</li>
  <li>Emotional stress is just one of many types of stress that cause damaging wear and tear on your body.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How does stress affect you?</h2>
<p>Stress has been with us since the beginning of time. Every era has faced its share of threatening situations. Today, the stress of work, project deadlines, personal conflicts and the demands on our time and money, take a huge toll on our health.</p>
<p>It may surprise you that your &quot;feelings&quot; of stress may have nothing to do with the stress in your life. Poor posture, prolonged sitting, an accident, or even an old injury can lead to spinal stress. Chronic pain and muscle tension can cause you to experience nervousness and irritability.</p>
<h2>The Chiropractic Lifestyle</h2>
<p>Chiropractors are experts in the care of the bones, nerves, muscles and connective tissues that make up about 60% of your body. All of the joints in your body are part of this musculoskeletal system and its optimal function is necessary for overall good health.</p>
