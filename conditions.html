	<h3 id="1">Back Pain</h3>
	<p>Causes of low back pain can vary from a bulging disc putting pressure on
	  the spinal cord or nerve roots to irritated facet joints which prevent normal
	  gliding. One of the most common causes is the vertebral subluxation which
	  irritate nerves. The chiropractic approach is to help restore a more normal
	  motion and position of spinal bones which can be causing nerve irritation.
	  Find out if yours is a chiropractic case and enjoy the positive results that
    millions of patients have discovered without the use of drugs or surgery. </p>

	<h3 id="2">Neck Pain</h3>
		<p class="quote" style="clear: right;">It is amazing remembering how long I was in pain and walked
		  with a cane and now I no longer need the cane.&quot;<br />
  <span class="name">-B.L.</span></p>
	<p>A complete case history and thorough examination can uncover the underlying
	  cause of neck pain. Medications only cover up the problem and usually don't
	  get to the underlying cause. Dr. Vactor uses specific gentle low force techniques,
	  structure and function is restored and the nervous system can function
	  optimally. Call Dr. Vactor for a consultation if you are suffering from neck
    pain.</p>

	<h3 id="3">Headaches </h3>
	<p>A frequently overlooked cause of headaches is the malposition of spinal bones in the neck and upper back. These bones can affect sensitive nerve and blood vessels which can produce headaches.     
	<p>Many people find relief and correction
	  with specialized techniques. Dr. Vactor has treated many patients that suffer with chronic headaches. It appears that chiropractors have been right all along. It's not in your <em>head</em>! In fact, a team of doctors at Syracuse University have established that it is all in your <em>neck</em> with scientific anatomical proof. They have pinpointed changed structures in the neck as the cause of the pain for many chronic headaches. &quot;It's true and chiropractors have been saying it for years,&quot; Toronto physician Peter Ridthbart concedes.</p>     
	   <p><a href="headache.html" class="btn">Learn more about headaches</a></p>
	<p class="quote">I  used to have a headache every day, along with lower
	    back pain. I suffered from both for more than 10 years. I had been taking
	    medicine for my headaches everyday. Chiropractic care works. Dr. Vactor
	    has changed my life. I feel free from all medicine. But you must commit
	    to wanting to get better and sticking with the treatments. I tell others
	    whenever I can how much Dr. Vactor has helped me and my son Russ. There
	    is hope and help that isn't in a bottle of medicine!&quot;<br />

	<h3 id="4">Stress Management</h3>
	 <p>Stress can harm the body. The major detrimental effect is a glandular imbalance,
	   which causes an imbalance of the autonomic nervous system. This is the system
	   that primarily controls the organs and glands. Stress that is prolonged ultimately
	   causes harm to the body. Chiropractic care, along with proper nutritional
	   support, can reduce the harmful effects of stress so that you feel good again
     naturally.</p>

    <h3 id="5"><a name="5" class="5"></a>Weight Management  </h3>
	<p>Achieve your desired body weight through balance. Experts are now calling
	  the fattening of America a national epidemic. Despite dramatically reducing
	  the fat in our national diet over the last 15 years, Americans continue to
	  put on weight. In 1991, one third of the population was found to be obese,
	  a 32% increase in 10 years. While intake of saturated fats and cholesterol
    were decreasing, the weight of America's young adults increased by 10 pounds.</p>
	  <p>It has been discovered that a balanced ratio of macronutrients (i.e. proteins,
	  carbohydrates, and fats) in our diets, along with proper calorie intake
	    and exercise are keys to permanent weight loss and optimum health. Find
	    out more by calling (724) 935-1610. </p>

<h3 class="top"><a name="6" class="6"></a>Auto Accidents  </h3>

	<p>Injuries to the neck caused by the sudden movement of the head -- backwards,
	  forward or sideways -- are referred to as &quot;whiplash.&quot; The resulting
	  instability of the spine and soft tissue can result in headaches, dizziness,
	  blurred vision, pain in the shoulder, arms and hands, along with a reduced
	  ability to turn and bend. These symptoms may not appear for weeks or even
	  months. Specific chiropractic adjustments help to reduce pain and increase
	  spinal function, motion and position of spinal bones. Consult Dr. Vactor before
    enduring a constant pain or having to depend on addictive pain medications. </p>
	  <p class="quote">I was in a car accident and my neck and back were
	      in very bad shape. I also had head tremors. My neck and back have improved
	      a great deal. I feel so much better. As for the tremors, they have improved
	      a lot also. My nephew and his wife are chiropractors and they made a comment
	      on my tremors. I must have a very good chiropractor, for they hardly
	      notice my tremors anymore.&quot; <br />
          <span class="name">-B.W. </span></p>
      <h3 class="top"><a name="7" class="7"></a>Sports Injuries </h3>
	<p>Many sports related injuries involve the spine. Spinal injuries can reduce
	  strength, slow reflexes, decrease endurance and performance. Chiropractic
	  is becoming increasingly popular with professional and Olympic athletes because
	  they demand results. Chiropractic helps relieve pain, reduce inflammation,
	  and improve joint movement, so your body can perform at an optimum level.
	  Sports injuries to children are often ignored. Regular checkups will help
    avoid many problems later in life.</p>

	<h3 class="top"><a name="8" class="8"></a>Trigger Point Myotherapy 	</h3>
	<p>At times, muscles can become very painful and sore. Properly applied pressure
	  to specific points help to greatly reduce the pain and help increase mobility.
	  It will also help to calm your nervous system and relax exterior muscle tension.
	  Along with chiropractic adjustments, trigger point myotheraphy can reduce
    pain so you feel your best and increase your flexibility.</p>

	<h3 class="top"><a name="9" class="9"></a>Menopause</h3>
	<p>It is normal and natural. There is a common misconception that the change
	  begins a time of inevitable and prolonged discomfort and declining quality
	  of life. The reality is that menopause only marks the end of child bearing
	  years. Supporting the body in its ability to manage a smooth hormonal transition
	  and replenishing its energy reserves is important to a continuously active
    lifestyle.</p>
	  <p>In harmony with that goal, there are specific vitamin, mineral
	  and special nutritional factors that can be taken. Dr. Vactor can develop
	  a program for you so you can look and feel your best naturally. Dr. Vactor
    is here to help, so please don't hesitate to call. </p>

<h3 class="top"><a name="10" class="10"></a>PMS</h3>
	<p>Women's hormones are powerful regulators of mind, body and emotions. Many
	  women find this especially true during the premenstrual days. Is your productivity
	  and feeling of well-being affected during your premenstrual days? You are
	  not alone. It is reported up to 1/2 of all American women between 20 and 50
	  years of age are affected by premenstrual hormone flux. Through proper nutritional
	  support, Dr. Vactor can help you really feel relaxed, peaceful and productive
    again naturally. </p>
