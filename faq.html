	<h3><a name="1" class="1"></a>What Is Chiropractic?</h3>
	<p>Chiropractic is the largest natural healthcare profession. By correcting
	  vertebral subluxations, the chiropractor removes nerve interference, enabling
	  the body to function at a more optimum level, which is essential for the body's
	  restoration and maintenance of health. Subluxations are caused by stress (physical,
	  mental or chemical) the person cannot adapt to. Subluxations can affect muscles,
	  ligaments and nerves. Pain can be observed in many cases. However, it is more
	  often discomfort or no obvious symptoms. If this condition is allowed to go
	  untreated, muscles can become rigid, discs can degenerate, and arthritis can
	  become progressive. The longer the condition is untreated, the less chance
	  for total recovery. What started as a minor problem can lead to destruction
	  of joints and irreversible nerve damage.</p>
	  <p>The purpose of chiropractic adjustment
	  is to return the subluxated vertebrae to a more normal position, thus restoring
    proper motion and nerve function to the affected area.</p>
	<h3 class="top"><a name="2" class="2"></a>Do I Have A Pinched Nerve?<a href class="backtotop"="#top"><br />
	  Back
    to Top</a></h3>

	<p>Many patients consult a chiropractic doctor because they think they have
    a pinched nerve. </p>
	<p>Because of the way your sPine is designed, abnormal spinal
	  function caused from physical trauma, emotional tensions, or chemical toxins
    can affect the delicate tissues of the spinal cord and nerve roots. </p>
	<p>While
	  commonly associated with the sPine, the pinched nerve (compressive lesions)
	  is actually rare. Researchers suggest that only 10% to 15% of sPine related
	  problems are caused by direct pressure of bone on nerve tissue! This can
    result in numbness, burning, or a &quot;pins and needles&quot; feeling. </p>
	<p>More frequently,
	  nerves are irritated (facilitative lesion). This is caused when nerve tissue
	  is rubbed, scraped, stretched by a loss of spinal curve, or irritated by
	  malfunctioning spinal joints. </p>
	<h3 class="top"><a name="3" class="3"></a>Do I Have A Slipped Disc?<a href class="backtotop"="#top"><br />
	  Back
	    to Top</a></h3>

	<p>Technically, a disc can't "slip."    
	<p> The intervertebral disc is a pad of cartilage-type material situated between
	  spinal bones. Each disc serves as a connector, spacer, and shock absorber
	  for the sPine. A soft, jellylike center is contained by outer layers of fibrous
    tissue. Healthy discs help allow normal turning and bending.    
	<p> Because of the way each disc is attached to the vertebrae above and below,
    a disc cannot "slip." However, trauma or injury to the sPine can cause discs to tear, bulge, herniate, or worse, rupture. This can be quite painful, as the soft center of the disc leaks, putting pressure on the adjacent nerve roots and spinal cord.    
	<p> While results cannot be guaranteed, many patients have avoided needless
	  surgery or a dependency on pain pills, by choosing chiropractic care for their
	  disc-related health problem. </p>
	 <h3 class="top"><a name="4" class="4"></a>How Does Chiropractic Work?<a href class="backtotop"="#top"><br />
      Back
	    to Top</a></h3>
	 <p>Chiropractic works by restoring your own inborn ability to be healthy. When under the proper control of your nervous system, all the cells, tissues, and organs of your body are designed to resist disease and ill health. The chiropractic approach to better health is to locate and help remove interferences to your natural state of being healthy.</p>
<p>A common interference to the nervous system is the 24 moving bones of the spinal column. A loss of normal motion or position of theses bones can irritate or impair the function of the nervous system. This can disrupt the transmission of controlling nerve impulses.</p>

<p>With improved spinal function there is often improved nervous system function. Your chiropractic doctor can help remove interferences that may be impairing normal health.</p>
<p>Since the primary focus of your care is improved nervous system function, chiropractic can have a positive effect on many health conditions not normally thought of as "back" problems.</p> 
	<h3 class="top"><a name="5" class="5"></a>What Do Chiropractic Doctors Do?<a href class="backtotop"="#top"><br />
	  Back
	    to Top</a></h3>
	<p>Helping to restore proper spinal biomechanics and improved nervous system function begins with a case history. This gives the doctor a background about your health, such as surgeries, accidents, the onset of your condition, and other details affecting your current health.</p>
<p>After reviewing your history and discussing your specific problem, a thorough
  orthopedic, neurological, and chiropractic examination is performed. X-rays
  may be taken to uncover structural and functional problems associated with
  the spinal column. These examinations help identify areas of spinal malfunction
  and resulting nervous system deficit.</p>
<p>The findings of these examinations are explained and a plan of chiropractic
  adjustments may be recommended. Progress is monitored with periodic examinations
  and follow-up reports.</p>
<p>Since the word "doctor" comes from the Latin work meaning teacher, regardless of your doctor's unique clinical approach, he or she has a strong commitment to patient education. </p>
	<h3 class="top"><a name="6" class="6"></a>What Type of Education Do Chiropractic Doctors Get?<br />
	  <a href class="backtotop"="#top">Back
	    to Top</a></h3>

	<p>Today's Doctor of Chiropractic is well educated.</p>
<p>The science of chiropractic requires a special emphasis on anatomy, physiology, pathology, neurology, biomechanics, X-ray, spinal adjusting techniques, and related subjects. This demanding curriculum prepares chiropractic doctors to locate the Vertebral Subluxation Complex and help correct the resulting nervous system dysfunction.</p>
<p>To graduate with a Doctor of Chiropractic degree, each candidate passes the demanding National Board Examination. Then, doctors apply to a governmental or professional licensing board and pass a still more difficult test before being granted the privilege to practice.</p>
<p>A chiropractic education never ends. Most doctors complete postgraduate instruction for license renewal and to stay current on the latest scientific research. </p>
	<h3 class="top"><a name="7" class="7"></a>What Is An Adjustment?<a href class="backtotop"="#top"><br />
	  Back
	    to Top</a></h3>
	<p>A chiropractic adjustment is the art of using a specific force in a precise
	  direction, applied to a joint that is fixated, "locked up", or not moving
	  properly. This adds motion to the joint, helping the bones gradually return
	  to a more normal position and motion. The purpose of this safe and natural
	  procedure is improved spinal function, improved nervous system function,
	  and improved health.
	<p>
<p>There are many ways to adjust the sPine. Usually the doctor's hands or a specially designed instrument delivers a brief and highly-accurate thrust. Some adjusting methods are quick, whereas others require a slow and constant pressure.</p>

<p>After years of training and clinical experience, each chiropractic doctor becomes highly skilled in the delivery of a variety of adjusting approaches.</p>
	<h3 class="top"><a name="8" class="8"></a>Are All Patients Adjusted The Same Way?</h3>
	<a href class="backtotop"="#top">Back
	    to Top</a>
	<p>The doctor evaluates each patient's unique spinal problem and develops an individual course of care. The resulting recommendations are based upon years of training and experience.</p>
<p>Some patients who complain of headaches, may actually have a lower back problem that is causing a compensation reaction at the base of the skull. Other patients may be experiencing numbness and tingling in their fingers, when the actual problem is in the neck. Every patient presents a uniquely different spinal pattern.</p>
<p>Patients notice that their chiropractic care is delivered with confidence and precision. Each visit builds on the one before. An while visits may seem similar, each patient's care is uniquely different from every other patient.</p>
	<h3 class="top"><a name="9" class="9"></a>Can I Adjust Myself?<a href class="backtotop"="#top"><br />
	  Back
	    to Top</a></h3>

	<p>Since a chiropractic adjustment is a specific force, applied in a specific direction, to a specific spinal joint, it is virtually impossible to adjust oneself.</p>
<p>It is possible to turn or bend or twist in certain ways to create a "popping" sound, like the sound that sometimes accompanies a chiropractic adjustment. Unfortunately, this type of join manipulation is usually counterproductive, often making an already unstable area of the sPine even more unsteady. Adjusting the sPine is not for amateurs!</p>
<p>The best way to enjoy the healthful benefits of chiropractic is to received adjustments from a Doctor of Chiropractic. Even your doctor must seek out the services of another colleague to help restore and maintain proper spinal function.</p>
	<h3 class="top"><a name="10" class="10"></a>Is Chiropractic Care Safe?<a href target="_self" class="backtotop"="#top"><br />
	  Back
	    to Top</a></h3>
	<p>In the words of the New Zealand government's inquiry, chiropractic care is "remarkably safe."</p>
<p>Chiropractic has an excellent safety record. It is the results of a conservative approach to health that avoids invasive procedures or addictive drugs.</p>
<p>A thorough case history and examination help reveal areas of the sPine that may be causing nervous system malfunction. This information will be used to determine the best course of care for each patient.</p>

<p>Chiropractic care is a natural approach to better health that is proven safe and effective. </p>
	<h3 class="top"><a name="11" class="11"></a>Can I Speed The Healing Process?<br />
	  <a href class="backtotop"="#top">Back
	    to Top</a></h3>
	<p>While there aren't any shortcuts to speed your body's natural healing process, there's a lot you can do to give yourself the best chance of a quick recovery.</p>
<p>Learn proper sitting and lifting methods. Specific exercises may be suggested to help retrain the muscles that support your sPine.</p>
<p>Proper rest is an important aspect of the healing process, too. Get the appropriate amount of rest your body needs and avoid sleeping on your stomach.</p>
<p>During the healing process, proper nutrition is more important than ever. Make sure you eat balanced meals, and if you're overweight, now would be a good time to slim down and reduce unnecessary stresses to your sPine.</p>
<p>Perhaps most important of all, keep your appointments and follow your chiropractic doctor's recommendations for optimum results.</p>

	<h3 class="top"><a name="12" class="12"></a>Why Do Children Need Chiropractic Care?</h3>
	<a href class="backtotop"="#top">Back
	    to Top</a>
	<p>Since significant spinal trauma can occur at birth, many parents have their newborns checked for the Vertebral Subluxation Complex.</p>
<p>Later, learning to walk, ride a bicycle, and other childhood activities can cause spinal problems. While a bandage and some comforting words can help a skinned knee, the unseen damage to the child's sPine is the unique domain of a chiropractic doctor.</p>
<p>Many childhood health complaints that are brushed off as "growing pains" can often be traced to the sPine. Regular chiropractic checkups can identify these problems and help avoid many of the health complaints seen later in adults.</p>
<p>Naturally, chiropractic adjusting procedures are modified to a child's sPine. Most parents report that their children enjoy their chiropractic adjustments and seem healthier than other children.</p> 
	<h3 class="top"><a name="13" class="13"></a>Am I Too Old For Chiropractic Care?<a href class="backtotop"="#top"><br />
	  Back
	    to Top</a></h3>

	<p>Most certainly not!</p>
<p>More and more people are consulting chiropractic doctors, especially in their later years. With growing concerns about over-medication and the side effects of combining various prescription drugs, safe, natural chiropractic care is growing in popularity.</p>
<p>Restoring better spinal function can help improve mobility, vitality, endurance, and appetite. Many patients report improvement with arthritic symptoms and other chronic ailments often associated with the aging process</p>
<p>The adjusting technique used by Dr. Vactor will be modified for maximum comfort and results.</p>
<p>As we get older and wiser, the simplicity and effectiveness of chiropractic care becomes more and more obvious. </p>
