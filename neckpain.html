<h1>Neck Pain</h1>
<p class="quote">&quot;If I had tried the chiropractic route when I was first injured, I think
  my pain would have been resolved earlier, and I may have avoided a tedious
  3-year pain treatment with orthodontics. The important thing is that my pain
  is resolved, I've had excellent care and Dr. Vactor and his staff are punctual
  and really care about their patients. I'm convinced, chiropractic works!&quot;&quot;<br />
   <span class="name">- M. J.</span></p><p> A complete case history and thorough examination can uncover the underlying
  cause of neck pain. Medications only cover up the problem and usually don't
  get to the underlying cause. </p>
   <p>Dr. Vactor uses specific gentle low force techniques,
     structure and function is restored and the nervous system can function more
     optimally. Call Dr. Vactor for a consultation if you are suffering from neck
     pain.</p>

   <h2>Your Nervous System and Your Body: The Key to Eliminating Neck Pain</h2>
   <p>Most people have been led to believe eating nutritious foods (including supplements), drinking plenty of fluids, exercising regularly, sleeping well and having clean air to breath will keep you healthy. Yes, these things ARE a vital part of living a healthy lifestyle -- but every function in your body is under the total control of your nervous system, which must operate at 100% for optimal health.</p>
   <h2>The Nervous System Houses Your Brain Messages.</h2>
   <p>Think about it -- your brain stores thousands of years of genetic coding far beyond our modern scientific understanding of the body. It wasn't programmed to make you sick or diseased -- ever. Each human brain and nervous system is 100% designed for optimal health and wellness and will manifest this every time unless interfered with somewhere in the system.</p>
   <h2>Posture is the Window to the Spine.</h2>
   <p>If posture is out of balance, the sPine is out of balance. this puts an unhealthy pressure upon your nervous system, which is known as subluxation.</p>
   <p>From normal activities as subtle as sleeping, standing or walking abnormally to more obvious trauma like emotional stress, work, auto or recreational injuries, or giving birth, there are numerous causes for this spinal imbalance. In order to have the best possible posture (and health), your sPine has to be in the best possible condition.</p>
   <h2>Only 10% of Your Entire Nervous System Carries or Perceives Pain.</h2>
   <p>Which means up to 90% can be heavily stressed without any alarms, whistles or bells! Vertebral subluxation is commonly referred to as the &quot;silent killer&quot; because there are usually no early warning symptoms.</p>
   <h2>The Importance of Good Posture for Neck Pain</h2>
   <h3><strong>All Your Life, You Have Been Told to &quot;Stand Up Straight.&quot;</strong></h3>
   <p>Hopefully, you have taken that advice. You will look better and have more energy if you do. Actually, there is much more to posture than most people realize. Your posture is the position of your ligaments, muscles and spinal bones and it affects the condition they are in.</p>
   <h3><strong>The Perfect Spine.</strong></h3>
   <p>From a rear view, your sPine should be perfectly straight with each of the 24 spinal bones stacked precisely on top of each other (figure 1). Looking at the sPine from the side, you should see three curves, each having a 60o arc (figure 2). It's been observed in nature, engineering, physics and geometry that a 60o arc offers the strongest defense against the destructive forces of gravity and motion. Optimal posture is a vital key to achieving optimal health for each person in your family.</p>
   <h3><strong>Establishing an Uninterrupted Nerve Flow is the Key to Optimal Healing.</strong></h3>
   <p>Your brain is continuously producing vital messages that are brilliantly decoded into electrical impulses, each with the purpose of performing an important function in a specific place within your body. Millions of these messages are sent every second of your life -- passing from your brain to your body cells, and equally important, from your body cells back to your brain. ANYTHING that interrupts the proper flow of electrical impulses through your nervous system should set off loud, beeping alarms in the body. But it doesn't -- not until a certain amount of damage has already been done.</p>
   <h3><strong>Vertebral Subluxation.</strong></h3>
   <p>As we mentioned, when spinal vertebra shift out of alignment, it puts damaging pressure on the spinal nerves, which causes an interruption of the vital nerve flow within your body. This condition is referred to as VERTEBRAL SUBLUXATION.</p>
   <p>Since your spinal cord (which carries your brain messages) runs inside the spinal column, it stands to reason that the spinal column has the greatest opportunity to interfere with the power of your nerve flow. In fact, that's exactly what does occur. Imagine the twenty-four moveable vertebrae which make up the spinal column (including the skull, sacrum and pelvis) undergoing continuous pressure from gravity. Add tension from prolonged or unusual patterns of sitting and standing. Go further and consider the strain from walking, exercising or injuries. Compound this with the stress that comes from personal, professional and emotional tension.</p>
   <p>If that weren't enough, it's also well known that chemical toxicity from foods, medications and the environment causes reflexive stress to your sPine. It's a wonder that healthy vital messages from the brain ever get to the body at all! Any spinal imbalance will cause areas of the spinal column to work harder in order to compensate for the area that is out of balance. This interferes with your body's innate healing ability and lowers your body's natural resistance.</p>
   <h2>An Optimal SPine Equals Optimal Health AND Helps Eliminate Back Pain</h2>
   <p>Take a moment (or better yet, take a lifetime) to appreciate the innate life force that controls all its functions.</p>
   <p>We will evaluate your posture and check for other indications of spinal imbalance. Regular chiropractic care will allow the body to re-establish its natural balance.</p>
   <p>Detection and elimination of subluxation will lead to a healthy nervous system at any stage of life. Make a chiropractic appointment and choose to begin your journey toward optimal health today.</p>
   <h2>Chiropractic Works for All Ages and Walks of Life.</h2>
   <p>Subluxations can begin at birth and progress throughout life. Interruption to proper nerve flow by subluxations can affect your overall health. Healthy cell metabolism, organ function and sharp mental focus are all jeopardized by decreased nerve flow. Correcting subluxations greatly improves the body's ability to regain optimal health. It's common to see whole families choosing chiropractic because no one is ever too young or too old to obtain a healthy nervous system for life.</p>
   <h2>Chiropractic is Safe, Gentle and Effective.</h2>
   <p>Chiropractic is the fastest-growing drugless healing profession in the world today, serving over 2,000,000 people every day. Chiropractors maintain the lowest malpractice insurance rates of any primary health professionals in the world, which is a tremendous credit to the safety record throughout the entire chiropractic profession. People who are under regular chiropractic care are among the healthiest people in the world, requiring far less hospitalization, medication and medical doctor visits.</p>
