    <h2>Our Patients Speak - Patient Testimonials</h2>
	<p>Before coming to see Dr. Vactor, I was having on acerage, 4-8 migraines a
	  month. I was using Immitex shots weekly and I also had very poor sleep.
	  Because of all of this I was having a lot of stress and fatigue. My upper
	  back and neck were always stiff and that affected all of my daily activities.
	  I love to be active, but I wasn't feeling my best and so I always seemed
	  to be missing out on all the fun stuff. </p>
	<p>Since going to Dr. Vactor, I have NOT had ONE headache. I am always active
	  and my stress level has greatly decreased. My sleep has also improved which
	  helps me to stay healthy. My overall outlook on life has improved and I
	  am much happier knowing that I am able to do anything without the worry
	  of a migraine coming on. </p>
	<p>Give this method a shot, it worked for me when I didn't think anything could.
	  There is nothing to lose! </p>
	<p>- Eleana Smith</p>
	<p>It has been 2 months since you straigtened my son Scott's neck and he is
	  doing great! Scott is not 5 1/2 months old and his balance has greatly
	  improved. He no longer has to have the painful exercises recommended by
	  the pediatrician and he is a much happier, more comfortable baby. The best
	  part of it all was that your gently realigment of Scott's neck did not
	  hurt him at all. Thank you for helping Scott. </p>
	<p>-Sylvia Enand</p>
	<p>I had been doctoring for head, neck and back pain for 3 years, taking two
	  medications for inflammation and pain. I can to Dr. Vactor with a sudden
	  onset of increased, intense neck pain that restricted my movement. </p>
	<p>Since seeing Dr. Vactor my mobility has increased. My pain is gone. I am
	  no longer taking medication, I decided I was too young to resign myself
	  to a lifetime exposure to Lodine. </p>
	<p>When I was first injured, my doctor referred me to a chiropractor but didn't
	  know anyone in practice . I continued seeing D.O. specializing in rehabilitative
	  medicine, at first twice a week, then once every 3 months. I resigned myself
	  to chronic pain. </p>
	<p>In a social setting, Dr. Vactor heard me mention this one day and invited
	  me to try chiropractic care. I finally did when I experienced a sudden
	  onset of symptoms and my doctor was not available. </p>
	<p>If I had tried the chiropractic route when I was first injured, I think my
	  pain would have been resolved earlier, and I may have avoided a tedious
	  3 years of pain treatment with orthodontics. The important thing is that
	  my pain is resolved, I've had excellent care, and Dr. Vactor and his staff
	  are punctual and really care about their patients. I'm convinced, Chiropractic
	  works!</p>
	<p>-Marie A. Jacko</p>
	<p>When I first came in to see Dr. Vactor, I was feeling very tired and depressed.
	  My hormones were very messed up. Even my joints hurt. He did a Nutritional
	  Evaluation on me and pinpointed the areas in my nutritional life that needed
	  improvement. I was then given whole food supplements. </p>
	<p>Since I have been seeing Dr. Vactor, I have improved tremendously! I feel
	  so much more alert!   My energy level is up and I don't feel so depressed.
	  My overall outlook and wellbeing is so much better.</p>
	<p>I will tell others to see Dr. Vactor. Make sure to talk to him about what
	  you are feeling and you will see great improvements!</p>
	<p>-Cindy Griest</p>
	<p>I realize you work on a lot of different people and problems. But since I've
	  been in so much excruciating pain, for 11 months, seeing so many different
	  doctors, trying a lot of methods, nothing has given me relief until I came
	  to see you. I can smile again and can walk out of your office with less
	  pain. I've begun to have so much hope that I will be completely recovered,
	  since the constant pain is being reduced after each visit. </p>
	<p>You really have a special touch and uniqueness which I am so grateful for.
	  I am overwhelmed with thankfulness and gratitude. Words can't begin to
	  describe my happiness. Thanks so much for being you. </p>
	<p>-Leslie Brennon</p>
	<p>The condition I had when I came into Dr. Vactor's office was upper back pain
	  and shoulder pain. The visits to his office have made my pain bearable
	  and I am more flexible. My moods have even changed since my visits. </p>
	<p>I really feel great when I leave Dr. Vactor's office. I always feel like
	  home when I visit since I'm from Florida. Dr. V. is a great guy and really
	  know what pain you're in and how to fix it. </p>
	<p>-Brenda Brown</p>
	<p>My condition when I came in to see Dr. Vactor was fatigue and concern regarding
	  food and nutritional advice. </p>
	<p>I have improved 100%. I have more energy and my body feels so much better.
	  My frame of mind has even improved. My eating habits, I thought were good
	  but now I know - Dr. Vactor hsa improved them. </p>
	<p>I would like to tell everyone to have only one visit with Dr. Vactor and
	  you'll have more. Dr. Vactor is a caring, knowledgeable doctor. He takes
	  great pride in caring for each individual person. I would recommend Dr.
	  Vactor for your whole family. He has also helped my children feel better
	  with a nutrition program designed for them. Plus, Dr. Vactor has the absolute
	  best secretaries in the world! </p>
	<p>-Shirley Jewell</p>
	<p>Dear Dr. Vactor,</p>
	<p>Thank you again for helping us, physically, during the last few years. I
	  could never thank you enough for your kindness while Lee was out of work
	  and when I didn't have insurance coverage. You were extremely thoughtful
	  and compassionate. We wish you only the best of luck - God bless you and
	  yours. </p>
	<p>-Sincerely,</p>
	<p>Cheryl </p>
	<p>A year ago I had a pain that wrapped around my chest from back to front.
	  My family Dr. sent me for a stress test for my heard proved that my heart
	  was sound. So I ignored the pain. Then a tingling sensation started from
	  back to front again and my family doctor sent me for x-rays of my spine
	  and gave me a prescription for an Nsaid - which is a very strong drug with
	  many side effects. So I didn't fill the prescription after reading the
	  side effects. I got the x-rays and took them to Dr. Ray Vactor. I do have
	  a small amount of arthritis but my spine was out of alignment and that's
	  what was causing the tingling sensation: pressed nerves. I feel comfortable
	  with the diagnosis. </p>
	<p>My improvement has been steady since my spine is being manipulated and gently
	  pushed back into alignment. I am also taking Glucosamine Sulfate which
	  is helping my joints - it seems to be improving my feet and wrist stiffness
	  as well and is natural without side effects.</p>
	<p>Consider other avenues of treatment before taking medications with strong
	  side effects. Also, read general medical books at libraries or book stores
	  and get to know all the aspects of an illness before just turning your
	  body over to someone else. </p>
	<p>-John Wainwright</p>
	<p>Dear Dr. Ray,</p>
	<p>I wan to thank you for all of the loving care you gave me and my family in
	  the few months we knew you. The generosity and kindness of you and your
	  staff was felt with the greatest appreciation. I personally was reminded
	  of the power I have; that we each have to heal ourselves and to take care
	  of ourselves. As we travel to New Hampshire, I pray we find someone soon,
	  a chiropractor like yourself who gives not for what he can gain in return,
	  but for the benefits  of his patients and to help share this work with many
	  others in return.</p>
	<p>God bless you Dr. Ray. May you continue to prosper and in great health. My
	  love to Kathy too.</p>
	<p>Love, Anne Carr and family</p>
	<p>Dr. Vactor,</p>
	<p>Thank you for helping me yesterday! If you didn't stop over on your day off,
	  I would have been bent over and uncomfortable until this morning when the
	  office was opened. Instead, I enjoyed my evening and had a great night
	  sleep. Going the extra step made the difference.</p>
	<p>Thank you, Paul Mitchell, Wexford Post Office Deli </p>
	<p>My ankles and knees were swollen most of the time and I had the constant
	  pain of arthritis in my ankles and knees and shoulder. After visiting your
	  office the swelling in my ankles is gone and I do not have as much pain
	  as before treatment. </p>
	<p>It was worth it to get the complete series of treatments to get relief of
	  pain without having to take the arthritis medication. It is amazing remembering
	  how long I was in pain and walked with a cane - and now I no longer need
	  the cane. </p>
	<p>Mrs. Betty Luczak</p>
	<p>This is a testimony to Dr. Vacto that I just had to share:</p>
	<p>In February of 2005, I was swimming and got a strange pain/feeling in my
	  neck. I left the pool and after driving home I got the most horrific headache
	  I've ever encountered. So bad that I called 911 and when to the emergency
	  room because I took my blood pressure and it was 200/100. In the E.R. I
	  was given the usual, CT Scan, MRI, and even agreed to a spinal because
	  I was so frightened. I was given a pain injection and sent home. </p>
	<p>Two  days
	  later on a Sunday morning, I awakened with another headache so severe,
	  I called 911 again with pain shooting down my left arm and a blood pressure
	  of 220/100, I figured I was &quot;a goner.&quot; After 3 days in the hospital and
	  a thousand dollars worth of blood work and brain scans, it was determined
	  that I suffered from migraines. I was given Initrex and two different kinds
	  of pain pills in case I had another attack. In addition, I was given blood
	  pressure medication and a thyroid supplement because the test showed that
	  my thyroid was too high. I kept telling the doctors I had pulled something
	  during my swim but they refused to listen. </p>
	<p>I was discharged on Tuesday and I called Dr. Vactor on Wednesday. He saw
	  me immediately, took x-rays, treated my neck and shoulders with heat and
	  we began regular chiropractic treatments. I was given exercises, and a
	  specific device to stretch my subluxated cervical vertebrae. </p>
	<p>It is now August 21, 2005 and I haven't suffered the first headache since
	  that terrifying Sunday in February. I haven't taken the first pain medication,
	  and, although I am still taking blood pressure pills, I have routine blood
	  pressures of 116/70 to 132/70. I am confident that with a little more exercise
	  and better eating habits I will soon be eliminating blood pressure pills
	  as well. </p>
	<p>In addition, I didn't tell my M.D. that I never took my &quot;hypothyroid medication&quot;
	  because he was monitoring my thyroid every three months and I wanted to
	  see what would happen if I let the chiropractic practice free my nerves
	  that feed my thyroid. Last week, my M.D. told me to stay on the same dose
	  of medication because my &quot;THYROID HAD RETURNED TO NORMAL.&quot; Please be advised
	  if you are taking thyroid pills: NEVER just stop taking them...this is
	  to explain Chiropractic helped me before I had to have the medication.</p>
	<p>I continue to see Dr. Vactor on a routine basis. I continue to stretch my
	  neck, and I am grateful for the Chiropractic expertise that God has given
	  to Dr. Vactor</p>
	<p>Sincerely, Karen Winters  </p>
	<p><strong>&quot;It
	  is amazing remembering how long I was in pain and walked with a cane and now
    I no longer need the cane.&quot; - B. L.</strong></p>
